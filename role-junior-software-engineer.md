## Title
Junior Software Engineer  

## Role Summary
This is the entry level role in the team. Junior Engineers spend a lot of their time learning the ropes and mastering the craft. They work closely with a senior engineer, who mentors and guides them. Junior Engineers handle the easier, sometimes time-consuming, tasks usually after the technical design has been done by a senior member of the team.

## Main Responsibilities
 - Learn and improve - together with your mentor, create a detailed upskill plan and follow up on it. Start mastering how to do different tasks according to best practices. Pro-actively seek feedback and adjust. Pro-actively learn the craft by observation, repetition and asking a lot of questions;  
 - Development tasks - work on development tasks with low to medium complexity, following the design by a more senior member;  
 - Uphold a great technical level - make sure the established best practices are followed. Make sure we are using up-to-date dependencies. Discover, document, prioritize and address technical debt;  
 - Technical Guidance - perform code reviews. Give constructive feedback to other engineers;  
 - Documentation - work on both internal and external documentation - make sure our users have the necessary guidance and support. Make sure we have a complete internal documentation - for setup, processes, technical decisions, etc.;  
 - Contribute to the team culture - be involved pro-actively in all processes in the team. Uphold the great working culture. Pro-actively propose improvements;  


## Requirements
<details>
  <summary>Intermediate Technical Skills</summary>

  - technical proficiency - the junior software engineer knows the basics of the tools of their trade - programming languages, frameworks, etc. They are also learning how to become proficient with the tools and technologies, what can be done with them and how to achieve it. The junior software engineer is learning the best practices;  
  - programming - a junior software engineer can solve basic to intermediate engineering problems on their own. Their solutions might not be perfect or in accordance with the best practices. Given good examples and guidance, they can understand and apply feedback in order to perfect the delivered results;  
  - algorithms and patterns - a junior software engineer has theoretical knowledge of a few basic algorithms and patterns. They are learning how to recognize and apply them in practice;  
  - theoretical knowledge of auxiliary systems and tools - a junior software engineer has theoretical knowledge of the most common 3rd party systems used in software development - ex. Databases, messaging systems, cloud platforms, CI/CD tools, etc. They are learning how to work with them in practice, their strong and weak sides and their potential applications;

<details>
  <summary>Continious Learning and Desire to Master the Craft</summary>

  Junior software engineers are curious by nature. They are self-driven in learning new things and exploring the unknown. They have the desire to learn every single detail of the systems and the tools they work with, understand not only how they work, but also why they were designed this way. They have highest respect for the craft and everyone who has mastered it, and are always seeking to learn from them.
