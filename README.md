# Engineering Position Levels
This repository provides position level definitions and detailed descriptions for each level. 

The roles are very simplified in just 4 levels, resulting in a relatively flat structure.
The descriptions are generic and not tight up with any particular technologies or tools.
The roles are titled as "software engineer", meaning that they are not limited to any particular part of software development, like back-end, front-end, DB, QA, etc., but are instead focusing on the fundamental tasks for developing any software application, and the skills and knowledge required to do so.
