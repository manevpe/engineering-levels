## Title
Software Engineer  

## Role Summary
The Software Engineer is the main role in a development team. They can handle most of the development tasks from design through implementation to deployment, however they are regularly syncing with a senior member, to validate their ideas, approach and the work produced. It is not expected to know everything and to be able to do everything, but it is expected to learn and continue mastering the craft.  


## Main Responsibilities
 - Development tasks - work on development tasks with various complexity;  
 - Technical design - propose good solutions to technical problems. Validate them with senior members. Hanle both functional and non-functional requirements - including, but not limited to quality, stability, perfomance and security. Incorporate domain knowledge into the decision and design process;  
 - Uphold a great technical level - make sure the established best practices are followed. Make sure we are using up-to-date dependencies. Discover, document, prioritize and address technical debt;  
 - Technical Guidance - perform code reviews. Give constructive feedback to other engineers;  
 - Documentation - work on both internal and external documentation - make sure our users have the necessary guidance and support. Make sure we have a complete internal documentation - for setup, processes, technical decisions, etc.;  
 - Contribute to the team culture - be involved pro-actively in all processes in the team. Uphold the great working culture. Pro-actively propose improvements;  
 - Learn and improve - create a detailed upskill plan and follow up on it. Pro-actively seek feedback and adjust. Start understanding not just the "hows", but also the "whys";   


## Requirements
<details>
  <summary>Advanced Technical Skills</summary>

  - technical proficiency - the software engineer knows how to use the tools of their trade - programming languages, frameworks, etc. They are also learning their intricacies, underlying principles, and the rationale behind their design. The software engineer is familiar with the best practices and can apply them freely;  
  - adaptability and versatility - the software engineer, given enough time, is able to adapt to new technologies or methodologies. They can switch between tools, languages, or paradigms without feeling tethered to any particular one, showcasing their flexibility and adaptability;    
  - programming - the software engineer posesses profeciant enough programming skills to solve most engineering problems. Their solutions might not always be perfect, but they work and achieve the business need. Given a little bit of guidance, they can understand and apply feedback in order to perfect the delivered results;  
  - algorithms and patterns - the software engineer has knowledge of the most common algorithms and patterns and can recognize when they see them applied in practice. They are able to recognize situations which could benefit from the use of a common pattern, and apply it in their design. They can perform a Complexity analysis during the design phase and choose the best solution;  
  - architecture and system design - the software engineer has learned the intricacies of the architecture in the systems and tools they have worked on and they understand their strong and weak sides. The software engineer can design a similar system by applying the familiar concepts. The software engineer has some high-level knowledge of alternative solutions and concept, but would need a lot of research to understand how to apply them properly;  
  - communication architectures and protocols - the software engineer has a good understanding how the different parts of their system talk to each other. They understand why the system was designed in this way and what are the benefits of those decisions. They are aware of the alternatives, but don't have experience with them;  
  - data storage - storing data is at the heart of most software applications and the software engineer must have an in-depth understanding of the data persistence in their system. They understand the deisgn choices behind that. They are also aware of alternatives and some of the trade-offs they offer;  
  - security - security is critical for all systems and a good understanding in the field is crucial for software engineers. They must be aware of the best practices and must keep up-to-date with new developments in security;  
  - performance - the software engineer can test and analyse the performance of their systems and find bottlenecks;  
  - domain specific technical knowledge - the software engineer posses a domain specific technical knowledge and can apply it in their day to day tasks - ex. working in the payments domain would require knowledge of payment protocols used by PoS devices, mTLS, Linux, cloud, and so on;  
  - expert understanding of CI/CD - the software engineer understands the benefits of frequent and short feedback loops and they take full advantage of the existing CI/CD processes;

<details>
  <summary>Product and Domain Knowledge</summary>
  
  - understanding of customer requirements - the software engineer posseses a good amount of knowledge about the domain they are working in. They can understand the requirements and the needs of the clients;  
  - bridging technical and non-technical worlds - software engineers are able to understand and translate product requirements into technical ones and vice versa - they can explain in plain and clear language any technical challenges, solutions and jargon to non-technical people;  
  - gathering requirements and feedback - software engineers are able to engage with clients, users and stakeholders, asking the right questions and understanding the needs behind the requirements. Pro-actively suggesting ideas for new developments and solutions, discussing them, taking feedback and adjusting in a timely manner;

<details>
  <summary>Critical Thinking and Ability to Make the Right Decisions</summary>

  - making informed decisions - softwareengineers make decisions which are baked up by extensive research, data analysis, previous experience and peer feedback;  
  - evaluating alternatives and understand trade-offs - software engineers are familiar with their system and its architecture. They know its strong and weak sides and the reasoning behind its design. They know what trade-offs were made and why, and therefore are aware of the limitations of the current design and can take them into account when discussing new requirements or designing new parts of the system;  
  - ethical and responsible decision making - software engineers are making sure their decisions are aligned with the company's ethics and responsibility commitments and keep the renome of the company - ex. keeping data privacy, treating users with respect and equality, lowering environmental impact, etc.;  
  - analytical rigor - software engineers are diving deep into problems, looking at them from different angles, breaking them into small pieces, and finding different paths to solutions;  
  - questioning assumptions - assumptions are often different from reality - the software engineer will always make sure their assumptions are verified and acurrate in the real world;  
  - continous reflection - software engineers frequently introspect their decisions, evaluate their successes and their missteps, ensuring continous learning and improvement;  
  - seeking feedback - software engineers actively seek feedback and take it into consideration, ensuring the success of their solutions as well as fostering a culture of collaboration and collective growth;
